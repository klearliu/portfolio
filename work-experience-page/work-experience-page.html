      <p>Teacher & Clerk | Aug 2013 - Jun 2018</p>
      <p class="title">Main Tasks:</p>

      </ol>

      <p class="title">Full Process (Teacher):</p>
      <p class="description">There are three main areas in the music studio:</p>
      <ol>
        <ul>
          - Beginner (books 1-12): 7 students
        </ul>
        <ul>
          - Intermediate (book 12 - RCM Grade 2): 8 students
        </ul>
        <ul>
          - Advance (RCM Grade 1 to 8): 6 students
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <p class="description">
        Due to the fact that I was RCM 7 prior to teaching, I was tasked to
        teach the advance students 95% of the time. So I will be focusing on the
        description of teaching the advanced section. Every 8 years the RCM
        curriculumn changes so we have to adapt our teachings to better guide
        the students to advance in Piano RCM. We have a set of flashcards that
        goes from:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <ul>
          - G1 to F7 RCM grade 3 and up
        </ul>
        <ul>
          - C2 to C6 book 12 to RCM grade 2
        </ul>
        <ul>
          - Only learned notes in the book
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p class="description">
        After recording the time it took for each student to complete the
        flashcards we go into scales ("Do-Rei-Mi") that falls into the RCM
        curriculumn. If scales are not up to expectations we will guide the
        students on techniques to learn how to play them, correctly, and up to
        tempo (the speed of playing) standards.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        It is now time for practical playing. Teachers generally listen to 2
        songs from each students or up to ~10 mins, which ever comes first. They
        then provide insights on if it qualifies as a pass or not. Passing is
        determined by if the students followed along well with the appropiate
        tempo (speed), rythymn, expression (designed intention of the musical
        piece), and dynamics (volume changes) presented by the RCM books. On the
        chance that students decide to part-take in the official RCM exam for
        their grades the marking will be more seriously. Passing a song in RCM
        means a student can further advance in the RCM books, which gives the
        incentive for students to continue their learning.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        We end it off with ear training (counting rythymns and replicating a
        melody while not seeing it initially) and sight reading (student reads a
        musical piece for the first time and play how it's intended). Teachers
        reveal answers afterward and provide insights. At the end of the hourly
        class, teacher's setup the new schedule for the next batch of students.
      </p>
      <p class="title">Full Process (Clerk):</p>
      <p class="description">
        Clerks are the only people who are authorized to open unless stated
        given temperorary permission. Upon opening they must power on all pianos
        and check inventories such as more books or missing headphones. They
        must do a quick inspection of each piano to ensure all keys are
        functioning. Clerks tend to show up 20 minutes before opening. They also
        check voice messages and emails for anything unexpected such as,
        reported absence. For the previous day, we check attendance and
        call/email any unexcused absences and reschedule if needed.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Clerks must handle any new students that want to enroll for piano
        lessons, therefore I must explain policies, promotional sales, and
        teachings to new students or guardian and register contact details to
        the database system. Payments are either monthly or buy 10 and get one
        free, clerks must be made aware of that and take in payments cash or
        card. The usual payments that customers line up for are: renewing
        lessons or buying the next piano books.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        For every hour the I must go to the beginner's circle and time
        flashcards to each student. This serves as a double check system for the
        new students and even though I am aware from my front desk, I must also
        be readily avaiable for any incoming customers at the line up phone
        calls. Clerks at the end of every month will generate a report of all
        employee work schedule and issue them a cheque, and for closing, I must
        power off all pianos and record daily sales.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        My most favourite job of all time! That is where I am going to start. I
        loved everything about it. I love playing the piano. I love sharing my
        skills to people. I love to see other ways of learning the same topic. I
        love it when I come up with new teaching metheods that students can
        grasp onto. The list of "I love..." can go much longer, but this is the
        important one, I love seeing that I had an impact in a student's
        learning. As of Jan 2024 and 24 years of my life, this was the job that
        I have stayed the longest in a employee setting. This job encouraged me
        to think outside of the box constantly and inspired me to even privately
        tutour piano and translated multiple pop songs onto the piano sheets,
        you can see them here {link coming soon}.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        You can see view a sample of my own personal piano books that I made
        here {link coming soon}.

      <p class="description">
        Being a teacher and clerk may seem repetitive to the masses and can be
        labelled as eventually boring to some, however they fail to realize that
        students develop both maturity and appreciation to learning. That is
        what makes teaching interesting and ever-changing. Enjoyed the
        environment so much, showed me what it is like to take leadership, and
        would consider any acceptance to any teaching jobs, both educationally
        or music.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The biggest skill I feel like you need as a teacher, and it may sound
        weird at first, is, manipulation. Ethically, I do not want to go
        further, but if you ask any experienced educational mentors they will
        agree. If they don't, they do not value their students as much as I do.
        If any recruiters want to know more about this, I'll tell you if you
        schedule an interview with me ;)

    <div>
      <br /><b>The Examiner - Edmonton, AB</b><br />
      <p>Route Carrier | Sep 2010 - Mar 2012</p>
      <p class="title">Main Tasks:</p>

      <ol class="description">
        <li>Gather a stash of newspaper delivered to my home address.</li>
        <li>Distribute promotional flyers into the newspapers.</li>
        <li>Deliver papers to mailboxes in specified neighbourhoods.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="title">Full Process:</p>
      <p class="description">
        Every Wednesday morning, around 6AM, a delivery driver would deliver a
        pile of newspapers with advertisement flyers in a seperate pile.
        Newspapers were your standard weekly news within the city while the
        flyers tend to be store flyers or coupons. They also gave a data sheet
        of home addresses that have requested no newspapers to be delivered to
        their houses; via the sign on their mailbox saying "No Junk Mail" or "No
        Flyers".
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        After manually inserting flyers into 300+ newspapers, I am tasked to
        deliver them to mailboxes based on my given route; generally the route
        assigned is always the same and tends your nearby area. Upon completing
        my route, I now have to markdown how many newspapers are remaining and
        notify the newspaper company if there were any new mailboxes that don't
        or now want their papers. This process is required so that they can
        assure an appropiate amount of papers are delivered to my doorstep for
        the upcoming weeks. They usually send 5% more.
      </p>
      <p class="description">Finally, I calculate my pay:</p>
      <ol>
        <ul>
          1x Newspaper = $0.10
        </ul>
        <ul>
          1x Flyer = $0.01
        </ul>
        <ul>
          {Newspaper + Amount Of Flyers} * {Amount Of Houses} = {My Weekly
          Payment}
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <p class="description">
        Here is a documented example that appears to be consistent:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <ul>
          Amount Of Houses: 336
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Amount of Flyers: 3
        </ul>
        <ul>
          $(0.10 + 0.03) * 336 =
          <span style="color: green">$43.61</span>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Approx hours worked: 5.5
        </ul>
        <ul>
          $43.61 / 5.5hr = $7.93/hr
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p class="description">
        During the 2010 timeframe direct deposit was not as a common way of
        paying. I got a check instead through the mail. Bi-weekly payment that
        is.
      </p>
      <p class="title">Insights:</p>
      <p class="description">
        This was my very first job. Yes, at the bare minimum, meaning no flyers
        are sent, would indicate a payment of ~$30/week, while working for 5 to
        6 hrs a week it does not matter! Why? Simple. I was a 10 year old kid.
        BAM!
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Working as a Route Carrier for the Examiner exposed me to what it is
        like to earn an income and that asking my mom for a toy "that is only
        $10" made me see that working for 2 hours of labour equated to the cost
        of that toy, and I should consider something of more value to spent on
        my income. Time to time when I go shopping digitally or locally I can't
        stop thinking about:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <ul>
          "is this $__ item worth __ of my hours worked?"
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p class="description">
        I am sure we can concur that this job is labour intensive and maybe seen
        as not worth, even if the pay was converted to today's value. We think
        this because we have to manually insert flyer(s) into each newspaper;
        which you don't get paid for, carry around a heavy cart of the sorted
        papers in the freezing cold or super hot days, and walk into properties
        to put the paper in the mailboxes all of that just for at least 10
        cents. My mom made a joke that I could just find a bunch of bottles
        around downtown and make even more, arguably less intensive. She is
        right to believe that. Again, this was my first job and it taught me the
        importance of time spent to work for an income at a pre-teen age.
      </p>
      <p class="description">I will end off on this note:</p>
      <ol>
        <ul>
          "To the neighbour with brown fences that had a 2 pitbulls... the white
          one is cuter"
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p class="description">Yeah, I saw a bunch of cute pups.</p>
